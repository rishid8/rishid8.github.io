## About

I am postdoctoral fellow in theoretical physics at Nazarbayev University,
Astana with an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of gravity,
its classical and quantum aspects. Earlier I worked at University of
Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing as a (visiting) postdoc fellow
during COVID-19 travel restriction. I also had a concurrent adjunct teaching
position at the Assam Science & Technology University in India around that time.

<br/>
Earlier, I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Physics at Fudan University, Shanghai.
My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Singularity resolution in theories beyond General Relativity
and some astrophysical implications" and it is supervised
by [Prof. Cosimo Bambi](https://cosimobambi.github.io/).

## My Research

Einstein's theory of gravity was proposed more than 100 years
ago and is still the current framework for the description of
the gravitational field and of the chrono-geometrical structure of
spacetime around massive objects. The theory has passed a large number
of observational tests in the weak-field regime. Very recently, we have
seen gravitational wave detection from binary black hole merger
by [LIGO/VIRGO](https://www.ligo.org/) collaboration and
the first image of a black hole by [EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/)
collaboration. However, there are still plenty of burning issues that need to be addressed.
Einstein's gravity has the singularity problem and the behavior of this theory is
still not well-tested at the strong regime. My research focuses on these two aspects
of gravitational physics and the interplay between them.




## Other Interests

When I am not procastinating with some physics problem,
I like to go for a run, hike in the mountains, read books or
watch cricket matches. You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/62170179).
 I have started a small library of books for personal use.
  Here you can browse my [libib catalog](https://hrishikesh.libib.com/).
