## About

I am postdoctoral fellow in theoretical physics at Nazarbayev University,
Astana with an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of gravity,
its classical and quantum aspects. Earlier I worked at University of
Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing as a (visiting) postdoc fellow
during COVID-19 travel restriction. I also had a concurrent adjunct teaching
position at the Assam Science & Technology University in India around that time.

<br/>
Earlier, I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Physics at Fudan University, Shanghai.
My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Singularity resolution in theories beyond General Relativity
and some astrophysical implications" and it is supervised
by [Prof. Cosimo Bambi](https://cosimobambi.github.io/).
<br/>


## My Research

My broad area of interest is the classical and quantum aspects of gravity.
My research has ranged from the physics of black holes and compact objects in General Relativity and
modified gravity to cosmology. Specifically, I am interested in the shortcomings of GR and
how modifications to the theory aimed at overcoming the issues affect observations
in both astrophysical and cosmological regimes.

<br/>
At present, I am working on cosmological models with a running Newton's constant (and variable dark energy)
which can induce a period of accelerated expansion in the early or late universe or a bounce
(see e.g. 2405.02636 in the context of asymptotic safety
and 2411.05965 for a simple parametrization to alleviate the $\sigma_8$ tension).

<br/>
## Other Interests

When I am not procastinating with some physics problem,
I like to go for a run, hike in the mountains, read books or
watch cricket matches. You can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/62170179).
